{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Agentes com Autogen - Function Calling - Hands-On\n","\n","Agradecimento ao professor Julio Cesar dos Reis pelo material.\n","\n","## Descrição\n","\n","Exploramos a implementação de agentes simples utilizando a biblioteca Autogen. O objetivo é demonstrar como configurar e interagir com agentes capazes de executar tarefas automatizadas de forma eficiente. Aprenderemos a estruturar prompts, configurar agentes com diferentes especializações e testar interações dinâmicas entre eles.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"8vgyXx0vadbJ"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ihsTM02Dablq","outputId":"c13c99b0-1cb5-4d78-b996-471ce5515915","collapsed":true,"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1756986691040,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":30896,"user":{"displayName":"Germano
